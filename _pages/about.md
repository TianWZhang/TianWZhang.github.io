I am a PhD student at the [Ruhr University Bochum](http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) and [Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Michael Walter](https://qi.rub.de/walter) and [Prof. Dr. Giulio Malavolta](https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/). I am interested broadly in lattice-based cryptography and quantum cryptography.
