Course Description & Syllabus
======

This topical course is meant as a follow-up to our introductory course Quantum Information and Computation and aimed at students interested in deepening their knowledge in this area. We plan to cover selected topics in quantum information and computation.

This semester we discussed the following topics:

* Quantum states and measurements beyond a first course
* Multiple quantum systems, partial trace, purification
* Schmidt decomposition, distance measures
* Nonlocal games
* XOR & binary constraint system games
* Self-testing/rigidity
* Quantum channels
* Shannon entropy and data compression
* Schumacher’s theorem and entropy for multiple parties
* Mutual information and Holevo bound
* Monogamy of entanglement

Students interested in a Master’s project in quantum information, computing, cryptography, etc. are particularly encouraged to participate. This course should be of interest to students of computer science, mathematics, physics, and related disciplines.

Recommended prior knowledge
======

Successful participation of Quantum Information and Computation (or an equivalent course).

Material & Lecture
======

Lecture notes and video recordings of the lectures will be provided (as well as additional pointers to the literature).

Learning outcomes
======

You will learn fundamental concepts and results in quantum information and computation that go beyond a first course, to prepare you for a research or thesis project in this area.
