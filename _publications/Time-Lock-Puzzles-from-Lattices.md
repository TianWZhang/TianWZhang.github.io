excerpt: 'Time-lock puzzles (TLP) are a cryptographic tool that allow one to encrypt a message into the future, for a predetermined amount of time $T$. At present, we have only two constructions with provable security: One based on the repeated squaring assumption and the other based on indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). Basing TLP on any other assumption is a long-standing question, further motivated by the fact that known constructions are broken by quantum algorithms. In this work, we propose a new approach to construct time-lock puzzles based on lattices, and therefore with plausible post-quantum security. We obtain the following main results: in the preprocessing model, where a one-time public-coin preprocessing is allowed, we obtain a time-lock puzzle with encryption time $\log(T)$; in the plain model, where the encrypter does all the computation, we obtain a time-lock puzzle with encryption time $\sqrt{T}$.  Both constructions assume the existence of any sequential function $f$, and the hardness of the circular small-secret learning with errors (LWE) problem.'
